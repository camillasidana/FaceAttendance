This project implements an automated classroom attendance system using face recognition.
It captures faces through a webcam, identifies known students using machine learning models, and automatically marks attendance in a SQLite database.

The project demonstrates:

Data storage & manipulation using NumPy and Pandas

Database operations (read, write, modify)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on facial embeddings

Feature reduction using PCA

Machine learning models (SVM, Decision Tree, KNN)

Performance evaluation using classification metrics

Version control and sharing via GitHub
